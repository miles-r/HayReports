   Contracts are not indicative to other regions of the state and do not 
pertain to the cash market.  The term "Season" Means that as long as the 
hay meets the contract requirements the buyer takes delivery on every 
cutting in that particular year.  All contracts are marketed on a per ton 
basis. Prices figured on a per ton basis or a per point basis (.xx times 
the RFV).  
   * - When priced on a per point basis.
   * - NEL basis for corn silage

   Haylage is based on 88 percent dry matter.  Haylage formula most often 
used (Haylage wet ton x percent dry matter/88 percent = 12 percent baled 
hay).  Haylage to be cut on an approximate 28 to 32 day cutting rotation.  
Quoted standing in the field.  

   Corn Silage 30-32 percent dry matter.  Based at .70 to .72 net energy 
for lactation (NEL).  Silage can be quoted standing in the field or 
delivered to the pit. ** All information is a basis for every contract 
and applies unless otherwise stated**
